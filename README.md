Library management system for ADF training

Simple Spring Boot app where books can be assigned to reader registered in the library with Angular6 frontend. 

Built with Maven, used Log4j2 for logging, JUnit4 for tests.
Set up basic exception handling, used JPA for configuring storage.

On frontend it is possible to view all books and add new readers/books.
